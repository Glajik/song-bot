# Song-Book
Service for creating collections of songs. It includes a web client, a mobile application and, in the future, a telegram bot.

## Set Telegram Token as an environment variable

To avoid using the secret key (the Telegram token is a secret key) within our code we can set up the Telegram token as an environment variable for your Firebase project. Once youâ€™ve got the token from the Botfather bot, we can add this value to the Firebase config:

    firebase functions:config:set telegram.token="<telegram-token-string>"
